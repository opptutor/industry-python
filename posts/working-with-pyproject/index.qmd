### update code samples on learning platform to use flet 0.80 using [uv sync –upgrade](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync)

Download code and unzip

* In the Industry Python course, Chapter 9 \- [https://industry-python.thinkific.com/courses/take/industry-projects-with-python/downloads/71672923-download-code-for-chapter-9](https://industry-python.thinkific.com/courses/take/industry-projects-with-python/downloads/71672923-download-code-for-chapter-9) 

Open with Cursor

* main.py  
* pyproject.toml

Use uv to sync and run the code

* README as setup and run instructions

### update version of app in pyproject.toml using [uv version](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-version) or manually update

Use uv to upgrade flet

* Look at header info in pyproject.toml (“before”)  
* Edit pyproject.toml header

```toml
dependencies = [  
   "flet[all]~=0.80",  
]
```

* More here: [https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/\#uv-sync](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync) 

In `pyproject.toml`, the `~=` operator is the **compatible release** specifier (PEP 440). It means:

* **Minimum version:** `0.80` (inclusive)  
* **Allowed updates:** newer releases that keep the same “major.minor” (`0.80.x`, `0.81.x`, …)  
* **Upper bound:** `< 0.81`

```bash
uv sync --upgrade
```

`uv sync --upgrade` will try to **update the locked (resolved) versions in `uv.lock` to newer releases**, then sync your environment to match.

What it upgrades is **bounded by your constraints**:

* Your `pyproject.toml` specifiers (e.g., `flet[all]~=0.80` means it can only go up to `<0.81`)

Edit description and add link to course

uv version \--bump patch

* This will increment the version number, which helps us keep track of upgraded code  
  * major: Increase the major version (e.g., 1.2.3 \=\> 2.0.0)  
  * minor: Increase the minor version (e.g., 1.2.3 \=\> 1.3.0)  
  * patch: Increase the patch version (e.g., 1.2.3 \=\> 1.2.4)  
* You can edit pyproject.toml manually, too


Before  

```toml
[project]  
name = "dec-vs-imp"  
version = "0.1.0"  
description = "Add your description here"  
readme = "README.md"  
requires-python = ">=3.12"  
dependencies = [  
   "flet[all]>=0.70.0.dev0",  
]
```

After  

```toml
[project]  
name = "dropdown-snack"  
version = "0.1.1"  
description = "Chapter 9 code for the Flet dropdown and snackbar tutorial. Link to course: https://industry-python.thinkific.com/products/courses/industry-projects-with-python"  
readme = "README.md"  
requires-python = ">=3.13"  
dependencies = [  
   "flet[all]~=0.80",  
]
```
