The NY Times recently published an article on [A.I. Washing](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/business/layoffs-ai-washing.html). Companies are increasingly pointing to artificial intelligence as a reason for cutting jobs — even when the real causes may include overhiring, shifting markets, or financial pressure.

The article highlights that more than 50,000 layoffs in 2025 have cited AI as a factor. Major companies like Amazon, Pinterest, and HP have all pointed to AI-driven restructuring when announcing job cuts. But researchers and economists are skeptical of how much AI is actually responsible right now. [Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/ai-and-automation-will-take-6-of-us-jobs-by-2030/) notes that when clients say they are replacing staff with AI, nine out of 10 have no mature AI solution in place — suggesting many cuts are financially driven with AI as a scapegoat.

Some experts call this trend "AI-washing" — framing financially motivated layoffs as a forward-looking AI strategy. It's an investor-friendly message: We're modernizing, we're efficient, we’re future-ready.

Research from the [Yale Budget Lab](https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/evaluating-impact-ai-labor-market-current-state-affairs) suggests AI has not yet meaningfully shifted the overall job market.

Much of the tech-sector job loss since 2022 appears to be a correction after massive pandemic-era overhiring — not a wave of automation replacing engineers.
