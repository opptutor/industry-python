This blog is for the free Industry Python course is for high-school students and early CS learners
who want to become internship- and interview-ready by building real Python applications. 

You’ll learn through interactive, visual apps where objects, lists, dictionaries, and
event handlers drive visible behavior, and projects grow from small scripts into structured
applications you can extend. As you progress, you’ll pick up industry-aligned patterns like
state management, separation of concerns, async programming, and basic deployment workflows.
In later chapters, you’ll build a real AI chat app using a local language model with
streaming responses. 

By the end, you’ll have portfolio-ready projects you can demo, explain, and defend.
